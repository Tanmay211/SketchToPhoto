Sketch to photo converter
This is the code to convert a sketch to a photo.
The idea behind the project was to create a photo from a sketch by downloading images from google and using techniques like grabcut , holefilling etc.
We recieved a json file in the starting of the code through a .js UI for the user where he can draw his sketch and label it.
All the paths used in the code should be updated before using according th the respective paths of the computer.
