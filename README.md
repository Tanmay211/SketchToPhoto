Sketch to photo converter
This is the code to convert a sketch to a photo.
The idea behind the project was to create a photo from a sketch by downloading images from google and using techniques like grabcut , holefilling etc.
we recieve a json file in the starting of the code through a .js drawing pad code.
All the paths used in the code should be updated before using according th the respective paths of the computer.
